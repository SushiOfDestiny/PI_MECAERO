### Context
School project where goal was to build a flying drone and optimize multiple characteristics such as structure's strength, stiffness and weight, propeller's thrust and noise.

### Code overview
Uploaded notebooks aim at identifying mechanical properties of potential materials of the drone's structure, based on mechanical tensile tests.
